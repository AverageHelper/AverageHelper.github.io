I'm nobody special. (My mother may disagree.)

I am software engineer of nine years, with proficiency in:

- Objective-C and Swift for mobile native frontend,
- TypeScript, Node.js, and Vue.js for full-stack web development.

I have written in Java. I think Java is brilliant, but I like Swift better. TypeScript is even preferrable. (I may be biased, but JetBrains IDEs feel like bloated messes compared to VSCode.)

I love writing with parenthesis. (I don't know why.)

I'm a huge fan of open-source software. Feel free to check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/AverageHelper), poke around, fork and play around with what you find there!
